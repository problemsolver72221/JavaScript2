### What do do (summary)
1. Make sure you finish the reading from last week (week0) and *type* the examples to understand what's happening
1. Do the reading for this week (week1)
1. Try the homework listed below 

We covered a bit of command line usage in the first class and got a program running which is great. If you need a refresher for the command line please have a look here: https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CommandLine

### Homework

1. In a file write the commands to type in the console to get to the Desktop of your computer and create a file called "HELLO.TXT" 

1. Write the commands to add the string "I love JavaScript" to the HELLO.TXT file

    Since we didn't make it as far as I would have liked last week please make sure you have done *all* the reading for week 0. You can find the reading here: https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript/tree/master/Week0

1. Write a program (like we did in class) that checks the types of two varibales and prints out `SAME TYPE` if they are the same type. 
For example: 
    ```
    var x = 9;
    var y = 'Hello';

    if () {
      console.log('SAME TYPE');
    }

    ```

    We didn't cover functions in class last week but I think you are all smart enough to try some code and understand what's happening. Here's a good introduction to functions: http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html which happens to be your reading for next week. 


1. I realize that we haven't covered all the topics but it will *really* help next class if you can try the following exercises:

### Next week

In addition to covering functions and the rest of the types in JavaScript we'll see how to run JS in the browser. If you're curious please have a look here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions
which shows some functions that are available only in the browser (as well as discussing functions).
