# Homework Week 8
This week you will work on finishing your application so it's actually useful!!

[Read this](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript/blob/laurens_thomas/Week8/README.md)

Make this
- Check if you have met all the requirements from the previous 2 weeks of homework
- Resolve your Github issues (DO NOT CLOSE AN ISSUE WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION OF BY REFERENCING IT FROM A COMMIT)
- Make sure you have implemented map, filter, reduce. If you lack inspiration, ask on Slack.
- Implement promises in your XHR
- Add polling to your SPA and make sure new info is loaded every 60 seconds. It's probably not a good idea to do a lot of requests every time so maybe just check if a user has new repos.
- Add a local data structure in which you ONLY store the info your app needs. So all the properties of your object should be used somewhere in your app. Don't reference the response of the XHR anymore, just reference your own data structure.
- Make sure you only have one request function that accepts a url parameter and a callback function
- Implement a loader icon like in [my codepen](https://codepen.io/Razpudding/pen/BRGqJw) for each xhr response the user has to wait for.
- Add correct HTML/CSS

If you get stuck, remember we have Slack and you can ask questions. On Slack there's also the list of repos of other students so you can check how they did it.
