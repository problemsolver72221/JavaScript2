# Reading material for the ninth lecture:

```
In week nine we will discuss the following topics:
• Promises refresher
• Object Literals (and other patterns)
• There is a TEST the second part of the day
```

### Here are resources that we like you to read as a preparation for the coming lecture:

Some nice resources about promises :ring:
- [Googles post about Promises](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises)
- [A nice article from David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/promises)
- [A real life example](https://github.com/mdn/js-examples/blob/master/promises-test/index.html)

- [Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

```
If you feel you need preparation for the test we recommend to do the following:
• Take a look at the topics listed in the [README](https://github.com/HackYourFuture) of this repo (up to and including week 9). 
• Review all the _REVIEW.md_ files in every week.
• Look up the concepts you are struggling with in your __Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript__ book :books:. 
• It's also useful to go through the reading material and homework of the last weeks.
```

_Please go through the material and come to class prepared!_
