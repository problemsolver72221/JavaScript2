# References
_We demand our student to be prepared (or at least to briefly read) the content of the class._

I'm concerned that a lot of students would like to have video resources, although my preference goes trough books.
If you would like to recommend resource that I should add, please pm me.

Module goals:
A good understanding of all the above mentioned topics. Want to check your Knowledge? Go through the [JavaScript Fundamentals README](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript/tree/master/fundamentalsand) and research/ ask for help (Slack!) with the concepts that are not entirely clear.
