# Homework Week 7

## Git Homework:

[Make these assignments](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md)

## Git Homework:
- Finish last week's assignment
- Solve all your Git issues. DO NO CLOSE AN ISSUE WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION OR CODE COMMIT REFERENCING THAT ISSUE
- Add map, filter, reduce to  your existing app to build an application that loads data from github, filters out based on certain value, map->reduces to a data object and render that object to the dom (using map again).
- Add polling to your app so that it checks every minute or so if a new repo has been made and if it has, adds it to the DOM without reloading the page.
- Add a readme to your repo explaining  what your app does and how to use your app. Here's a [template](https://gist.github.com/jxson/1784669) and here you can see how to make [your readme awesome](https://gist.github.com/rrgayhart/91bba7bb39ea60136e5c).

### Step 2: **Some freeCodeCamp challenges:**

1. [Comparisons with the Logical And Operator](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/comparisons-with-the-logical-and-operator)

2. [Record Collection](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/record-collection)

3. [Iterate over Arrays with map](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/iterate-over-arrays-with-map)



## What we did in lecture 1:
Code Kata Race

- [Problem 1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/keep-up-the-hoop)
- [Problem 2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-first-non-consecutive-number)
- [Problem 3](https://www.codewars.com/kata/negation-of-a-value)


## Js Homework (ALL OF YOU SHOULD TO AT LEAST ATTEMPT PROBLEMS 1-5):
- [Homework](https://www.codewars.com/collections/hyf-homework-1)
- [BONUS](https://www.codewars.com/collections/hyf-homework-1-bonus-credit) :collision:

Remember the person with the most kata points gets a prize from Gijs (and you can do exercises on this website without me telling you to - anything kyu 7 or kyu 8 you can try to do - kyu 6 or lower is probably too hard)

- Hint for Q1: split your code into two parts, one part for the case that one of the two strings has an extra letter at the start or the end but is otherwise identical & one part for the case that the strings are the same length but one character is different in one of the strings
- Also for Q1 this function on strings might be useful: [JavaScript String slice() method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_string.asp)
- Also potentially useful: [JavaScript String charAt() Method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_charat.asp)
- [Hint for Q2](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.asp) Also there are no sample tests, you need to use submit

## To watch before the next lecture:
(watch in this order)

1. [Stacks/Queues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjI1WNcIntg) (5 mins)
2. [JS Event Loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) (26 mins, watch this one twice or until you understand it)
