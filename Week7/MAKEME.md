## Git Homework:

[Make these assignments](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md)

## Git Homework:
- Finish last week's assignment
- Solve all your Git issues. DO NO CLOSE AN ISSUE WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION OR CODE COMMIT REFERENCING THAT ISSUE
- Add map, filter, reduce to  your existing app to build an application that loads data from github, filters out based on certain value, map->reduces to a data object and render that object to the dom (using map again).
- Add polling to your app so that it checks every minute or so if a new repo has been made and if it has, adds it to the DOM without reloading the page.
- Add a readme to your repo explaining  what your app does and how to use your app. Here's a [template](https://gist.github.com/jxson/1784669) and here you can see how to make [your readme awesome]https://gist.github.com/rrgayhart/91bba7bb39ea60136e5c).
