## Assignments week 1:

1. Create a `.js` file that prints `Hello` when you run it from the command line. (Hint: `node` is the program that can run your JavaScript files.)

2. Create a function named `colorCar` that receives a color, and prints out, "a red car" for example. (Hint: put it in your file and run it like before.)

3. Create a function named `vehicleType` that receives a color, and a code, 1 for car, 2 for motorbike. And prints "a blue motorbike" for example when called as `vehicleType("blue", 2)`

4. Create a function called `vehicle`, like before, but takes another parameter called age, so that `vehicle("blue", 1, 5)` prints "a blue used car"

5. Make a list of vehicles, you can add `"motorbike"`, `"caravan"`, `"bike"`, or more.

6. How do you get the third element from that list?

7. Change the function `vehicle` to use the list of question 5. So that `vehicle("green", 3, 1)` prints "a green new caravan".

8. Use the list of vehicles to write an advertisment. So that it prints something like: `"Amazing Joe's Garage, we service cars, motorbikes, caravans and bikes."`. (Hint: use a `for` loop.)

9. What if you add one more vehicle to the list, can you have that added to the advertisement without changing the code for question 8?
