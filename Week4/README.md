### Reading Week 4

Read your book ('A Smarter Way To Learn JavaScript')! If you don't do it on yourself, here's the chapters to read next for next week:
*Note: If you already know the material you are reading just take a glance over it and don't use too much time. Just be sure that you get everything! You may have already read about it, or used it  in the previous classes. Note that this also has 'catch up' material in it, about functions and objects. If you did not take the time to read your book yet about these things please do so!*

* DOM (may have known material, know how to select/search/append elements etc.!):
Chapters 58 - 68

* Reading/setting input fields:
Chapters 49 - 50

* Functions (if you think you need a bit more understanding of them read this):
Chapters 35 - 38

* Objects (important to really understand them, read this if you are unsure! You may also read chapters 72, 73 and 74 if you have time and want to learn more):
Chapters 70-71, 75
