custom challenge:
1. Go to http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=dog and change the word dog in the url to a different common word. You will get as a result, a list of movies with this word in the title. Make sure you get at least 5 results.
2. You can copy the JSON and put it in a string at the top of your js file. Print the title of the 3rd movie in the array to the console.
3. Make a ul with a li for each title (just like you did with the books in the previous assignment
4. Use CSS to divide the page in two columns. The left column will have a list of the titles for each movie. The right column will have all the information listed for each movie.
5. Replace the "Poster" property with the actual image of the poster. If you do this correctly, in the right column there will be a picture for each movie.
6. Use the imdbID to create an URL to the IMDB page for that movie (hint: IMDB urls always look like this http://www.imdb.com/title/[imdbId] where [imdbId] would be replaced by the actual Id. If you do this correctly, each movie will have a link to its own IMDB page. Make sure the link opens in a new tab
7. Make a Github Repository for your javascript homework. Store your solutions in this repo. Put the repo link in trello. NO MORE ZIP FILES :octocat:
