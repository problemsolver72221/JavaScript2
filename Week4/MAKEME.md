# Homework Week 4

>[Here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript/tree/master/Week4/README.md) you find the readings you have to complete before the fifth lecture.

## Step 0: Make a small dance
Give yourself (or your neighbor) a little tap on the shoulder, you've made it to JS2! :muscle:

## Step 1: Share a useful resource

_Deadline Monday_

All share a video or a resource (this can be a drawing, article or a pod cast) that was helpful for you the last few weeks with learning JavaScript. Please share this in the channel of your class in Slack. Also write as small note about what the resource i about and why you think it's so helpful (you can share more than one if you like).

## Step 2: Feedback

_Deadline Monday_

Give one of your fellow students in Github feedback about their homework of the previous week: create an issue in their repo, telling them what they did great and what they can improve.

## Step 3: Git branching homework

_Deadline Wednesday_

1) Use the `unmeshvrije/MyFirst` repository (the one you cloned) for this homework.

2) Make a branch.

3) Name it YOUR-GITHUB-NAME-dev

4) Create a file commands.txt in your branch.

5) Add bash commands that you have learnt with descriptions

6) Then git add, commit and push them in a remote branch.

**Do not merge the changes to master branch.**

**Do not make any changes to master branch.**

## Step 3: Some Challenges
Let's practice working with Objects and Arrays. Go to FreeCodeCamp and complete all challenges under "Object Oriented and Functional Programming" and the _first four challenges_ under "Basic Algorithm Scripting", up until 'Find the longest word in a string.'

How to hand in your homework:
• Create a new repository "hyf-javascript2". Also create a new folder "week1" inside this repository. 
• Upload your homework files inside the week1 folder and write a description for this “commit”.
• Your hyf-javascript2/week1 should now contain the files of your homework.
• Place the link to your repository folder in Trello.
```
