# Homework Week 4

```
Topics discussed in class this week:
• Git
```


>[Here](/Week4/README.md) you find the readings you have to complete before the fifth lecture.

## Step 0: Make a small dance
Give yourself (or your neighbor) a little tap on the shoulder, you've made it to JS2! :muscle:

## Step 1: Share a useful resource

_Deadline Monday_

All share a video or a resource (this can be a drawing, article or a pod cast) that was helpful for you the last few weeks with learning JavaScript. Please share this in the channel of your class in Slack. Also write as small note about what the resource i about and why you think it's so helpful (you can share more than one if you like).

## Step 2: Feedback

_Deadline Monday_

Give one of your fellow students in Github feedback about their homework of the previous week: create an issue in their repo, telling them what they did great and what they can improve.

## Step 3: Git homework

_Deadline Wednesday_

Git homework for this week:

Pair up with another student in your class. The homework requires two people to work together. Let us call them admin and user.

1. admin creates a new repository on github called “animals” (without quotes).
2. admin adds a file called “zoo.txt” with some animal generally found in a zoo.
3. admin commits and pushes his changes (in master branch)
4. admin adds user as a collaborator (find out how to add a collaborator to a git repository)
5. user clones a repository from admin (find out how to clone a repository. Note that `git init` is not required when you clone a repository)
6. user makes a new branch called user-dev
7. user adds another file called “pets.txt” with some animals generally found in a home.
8. user commits and pushes his branch to remote
9. admin pulls the branch crated by user (find out how to pull changes from the repository)
10. admin submits the link to his github repository (named animal), where unmesh should be able to see the collaborator’s (i.e. user’s) branch along with his commits.

Note:

The *user* is  *not supposed to fork* the admin’s repository. *admin* is supposed to add user as a collaborator and *user* should just *clone* the repository (i.e. *user* will only have the local copy of the repository). Only *admin* will have the *github* server copy of the repository. Of course, admin will have its local copy of the repository too.


## Step 3: Some Challenges

_Deadline Saturday_

Let's practice working with Objects and Arrays. Go to FreeCodeCamp and complete all challenges under "Object Oriented and Functional Programming" and the _first four challenges_ under "Basic Algorithm Scripting", up until 'Find the longest word in a string.'

### Step 4: Read before next lecture

_Deadline Sunday morning_

Go trough the reading material in the [README.md](/Week4/README.md) to prepare for your next class

```
How to hand in your homework:
• Create a new repository "hyf-javascript2". Also create a new folder "week1" inside this repository. 
• Upload your homework files inside the week1 folder and write a description for this “commit”.
• Your hyf-javascript2/week1 should now contain the files of your homework.
• Place the link to your repository folder in Trello.
