# Homework Week 4

>[Here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript/tree/master/Week4/README.md) you find the readings you have to complete before the fifth lecture.

## Step 0: 
Give yourself (or your neighbor) a little tap on the shoulder, you've made it to JS2! :muscle:

## Step 1: Feedback

Give one of your fellow students in Github feedback about their homework of the previous week: create an issue in their repo, telling them what they did great and what they can improve.

### Step 2: Git branching homework

1) Use the `unmeshvrije/MyFirst` repository (the one you cloned) for this homework.

2) Make a branch.

3) Name it YOUR-GITHUB-NAME-dev

4) Create a file commands.txt in your branch.

5) Add bash commands that you have learnt with descriptions

6) Then git add, commit and push them in a remote branch.

**Do not merge the changes to master branch.**

**Do not make any changes to master branch.**

## Step 3: Some Challenges
Let's practice working with Objects and Arrays. Go to FreeCodeCamp and complete all challenges under "Object Oriented and Functional Programming" and the _first four challenges_ under "Basic Algorithm Scripting", up until 'Find the longest word in a string.'

How to hand in your homework:
• Create a new repository "hyf-javascript2". Also create a new folder "week1" inside this repository. 
• Upload your homework files inside the week1 folder and write a description for this “commit”.
• Your hyf-javascript2/week1 should now contain the files of your homework.
• Place the link to your repository folder in Trello.
