# Homework for the extra JavaScript module Class8

## What we did in lecture 1:
Code Kata Race

- Problem 1 https://www.codewars.com/kata/keep-up-the-hoop
- Problem 2 https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-first-non-consecutive-number
- Problem 3 https://www.codewars.com/kata/negation-of-a-value


## Homework week 1: (I EXPECT ALL OF YOU TO AT LEAST ATTEMPT PROBLEMS 1-5):
- https://www.codewars.com/collections/hyf-homework-1
- https://www.codewars.com/collections/hyf-homework-1-bonus-credit

Remember the person with the most kata points gets a prize from Gijs (and you can do exercises on this website without me telling you to - anything kyu 7 or kyu 8 you can try to do - kyu 6 or lower is probably too hard)

- Hint for Q1: split your code into two parts, one part for the case that one of the two strings has an extra letter at the start or the end but is otherwise identical & one part for the case that the strings are the same length but one character is different in one of the strings
- Also for Q1 this function on strings might be useful https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_string.asp
- Also potentially useful
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_charat.asp
- Hint for Q2: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.asp Also there are no sample tests, you need to use submit

## To watch before second lecture:
(watch in this order)
