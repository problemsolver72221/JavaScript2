And a custom DOM manipulation challenge :mortar_board:
1. Make a list of >= 10 books you've read, store it in an array, log the array
2. Create a basic html file called inxed.html and use it to load the js file, confirm the console.log show the lists
3. Generate a `ul` with a `li` for each book in the array using a forloop and a function
4. Use a forloop to generate objects for each book, then add at least the following properties to each object: title, language, author. Change the function generating the `ul` so that it now generates a section for each object.
5. Fill each section with the details you have for each book using a function. Make sure you choose the right html elements for each piece of info, for instance, a heading for the title.
6. Download book covers for each book, give each book object a property storing the location of the cover image for that book. write a function that uses a query selector to select each of the previously generated sections and insert a generated `img` element that shows the books cover.
7. Beautify your html page with css, add sources and alts to each of the images.
