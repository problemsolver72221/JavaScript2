//1. Map the tasks to durations in hours:

const taskMapping = tasks.map((i) => i.duration / 60)

//2. Filter out everything that took less than two hours:

const plusTwoHour = taskMapping.filter((i) => i >= 2)

//3. Multiply the each duration by a per-hour rate for billing and sum it all up.

let maartjteRate = 9.67;
const maartjteSalary = plusTwoHour.reduce((sum,i) => {return sum + i * maartjteRate}, 0)

//4. Output a formatted Euro amount, rounded to Euro cents:

let euroFormat = "â‚¬" + (maartjteSalary * 10.31).toFixed(2)
console.log(euroFormat);
